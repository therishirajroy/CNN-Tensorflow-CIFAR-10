    This application is a web-based interface for a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the famous [**CIFAR-10 dataset**](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

    ### What is CIFAR-10?
    The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 small (32x32 pixels) color images, categorized into 10 distinct classes:
    - ‚úàÔ∏è Airplane
    - üöó Automobile
    - üê¶ Bird
    - üê± Cat
    - ü¶å Deer
    - üê∂ Dog
    - üê∏ Frog
    - üê¥ Horse
    - üö¢ Ship
    - üöö Truck

    ### Model Architecture
    The deep learning model used here is a standard CNN. CNNs are specifically designed to process pixel data and are highly effective for image recognition tasks. 
    The model building and evaluation is in this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16GEkZlAWuwTHLu-OgImslHMcqYCDQW6t?usp=sharing).
    The architecture typically includes:
    1.  **Convolutional Layers:** To automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input images.
    2.  **Pooling Layers:** To reduce the dimensionality of each feature map but retain the most important information.
    3.  **Fully Connected Layers:** To perform classification based on the high-level features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers.

                The model was built using TensorFlow/Keras and saved as `cifar10nn.keras`. You can interact with it on the **Inference** page!
                ### How to Use This App
                1. Navigate to the **Inference** page using the sidebar.
                2. Upload an image of an object that you want to classify.
                3. The model will predict the class of the object and display the result along with the confidence level.
