## üìñ About The Project

This project serves as a practical demonstration of deploying a deep learning model. A CNN was trained to classify images into one of the 10 classes of the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The trained model (`cifar10nn.keras`) is then served through an interactive web interface created using the Streamlit framework.

The application allows users to upload their own images and receive a real-time classification prediction from the model.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive UI**: A clean and simple user interface powered by Streamlit.
* **Real-Time Inference**: Upload an image and get an instant prediction from the CNN model.
* **Sidebar Navigation**: Easy navigation between the "About," "Inference," and "Student Info" pages.
* **Model Information**: The "About" page provides a brief explanation of the model architecture and the dataset.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project was built using the following technologies:

* **Python**: The core programming language.
* **Streamlit**: For building and deploying the web application.
* **TensorFlow / Keras**: For loading and using the pre-trained deep learning model.
* **Pillow**: For image manipulation.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data preprocessing.

## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed on your system.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/therishirajroy/CNN-Tensorflow-CIFAR-10.git](https://github.com/therishirajroy/CNN-Tensorflow-CIFAR-10.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd CNN-Tensorflow-CIFAR-10
    ```
3.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file**
    If you don't have one, create a file named `requirements.txt` and add the following lines:
    ```
    streamlit
    tensorflow
    Pillow
    numpy
    ```
4.  **(Optional but Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
5.  **Install the required packages**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

---

## üîß Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can run the application with a single command:

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

Your web browser will automatically open to the application's URL.

1.  Navigate to the **Inference** page using the sidebar.
2.  Click the "Upload an image..." button to select an image file (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`).
3.  The app will display the image and the model's predicted label below it.
